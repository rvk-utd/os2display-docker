# Auto-import state
The development setup will auto-import files and database dumps if placed here

* Database: place an admin.sql.gz mysqldump file in this directory
* Files: place a uploads.tar.gz file in this directory. The tar-ball must 
  include the uploads-directory, eg. the following directory should probably
  exist in the tarball: `uploads/media/default/0001/01/`
